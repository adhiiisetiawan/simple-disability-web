                    According to the 2015 Disability at a Glance statistical data by UNESCAP, Japan ranks third with the
                    largest number of people with disabilities in Southeast Asian countries with a total of 5,111,600
                    people (6.2%). This has become the basis for the government and its citizens to pay attention to
                    persons with disabilities. Like the Law on the Elimination of Discrimination against Persons with
                    Disabilities made the government make further revisions and made many disabled people get jobs.
                    Various public facilities have been prepared, special schools for disabled people are built with
                    adequate systems and facilities, special teachers are trained and empowered to teach students with
                    disabilities, technology is made to facilitate them, and the most important is to shape the
                    mentality of its citizens to accept their whereabouts without any discrimination or negative views
                    towards persons with disabilities.
                    The word "person" is defined as someone who is suffering (suffering) something. The word
                    "disability" is a condition or function that is considered to experience significant disruption
                    compared to the usual standards of a person or group. This term is used to refer to individual
                    functions, including physical disorders, sensory disorders, cognitive disorders, mental disorders,
                    and various types of chronic diseases. Thus, a person with a disability is anyone who experiences
                    physical, intellectual, mental, and / or sensory limitations in the long term that in interacting
                    with the environment can experience obstacles and difficulties to participate fully and effectively
                    with other citizens based on equal rights.
                    Over time, there is a term that is considered better than the term "Persons with Disabilities",
                    which is Diffable when spoken in Indonesian is Difabel. Diffable or Different Able People is someone
                    who has the ability, the same as people in general. But in a different way. An acronym that is
                    considered more neutral and humane for those who are considered to have physical or psychological
                    limitations. For example, a Deaf has communication skills, but in a different way, that is, using
                    sign language, or a person who has obstacles when mobilizing, they have the ability to mobilize but
                    are assisted by using a wheelchair when mobilizing.

                    <p>Categories of disability types include various physical and mental impairments that can hamper or
                        reduce a person's ability to carry out their day to day activities. These impairments can be
                        termed as disability of the person to do his/her day to day activities. Disability can be broken
                        down into a 4 main types of disability.</p>

                    <p>A physical disability is the long-term loss or impairment of part of a personâ€™s body function,
                        resulting in a limitation of physical functioning, mobility, dexterity or stamina. Due to the
                        functional loss the person will experience the inability to perform normal movements of the
                        body, such as walking and mobility, sitting and standing, use of hands and arms, muscle control,
                        etc.

                        The two major categories of physical disabilities are: (1) the musculo skeletal disability,
                        including loss or deformity of limbs, Osteogensis Imperfecta and muscular dystrophy; and (2) the
                        neuro musculo disability, including cerebral palsy, Spina Bifida, poliomyelitis, stroke, head
                        injury and spinal cord injury. The musculo skeletal disability is defined as the inability to
                        carry out distinctive activities associated with movements of the body parts due to mucular or
                        bone deformities, diseases or degeneration. The neuro musculo disability is defined as the
                        inability to perform controlled movements of affected body parts due to diseases, degeneration
                        or disorder of the nervous system.</p>

                    <p>Blindness is a general term used for the condition of someone who has a disorder or a barrier in
                        their sense of sight. Based on the level of impairment Blind people are divided into two, namely
                        total blindness and those who still have vision (Low Vision). Aids for mobility for the blind

                        decrease in the function of the sense of sight, the blind try to maximize the function of the
                        other senses such as, touch, smell, hearing, and so forth so that not a few blind people who

                    <p>Hearing impairment, deafness, or hearing loss refers to the total or partial inability to hear
                        sounds.
                        Symptoms may be mild, moderate, severe, or profound. A patient with a mild hearing impairment
                        may have understanding speech problems, especially if there is a lot of noise around, while
                        those with moderate deafness may need a hearing aid.
                        Some people are severely deaf and rely on lip-reading to communicate with others. People who are
                        profoundly deaf can hear nothing at all and can find themselves totally reliant on lip-reading
                        or sign language.
                        In the United States, around 15 percent of people over the age of 18 years report some level of
                        hearing loss.</p>

                    <img src="assets/image/accessibility.jpg" alt="accessibility" class="featured-image">
                    <p>
                        Accessibility in the sense considered here refers to the design of products, devices, services,
                        or
                        environments so as to be usable by people with disabilities. The concept of accessible design
                        and
                        practice of accessible development ensures both "direct access" (i.e. unassisted) and "indirect
                        access" meaning compatibility with a person's assistive technology (for example, computer screen
                        readers).

                        Accessibility can be viewed as the "ability to access" and benefit from some system or entity.
                        The
                        concept focuses on enabling access for people with disabilities, or special needs, or enabling
                        access through the use of assistive technology; however, research and development in
                        accessibility
                        brings benefits to everyone.

                        Accessibility is not to be confused with usability, which is the extent to which a product (such
                        as
                        a device, service, or environment) can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals
                        with
                        effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use.

                        Accessibility is strongly related to universal design which is the process of creating products
                        that
                        are usable by people with the widest possible range of abilities, operating within the widest
                        possible range of situations. This is about making things accessible to all people (whether they
                        have a disability or not).

                    <h3>Wheelchair Ramp</h3>
                    <img src="assets/image/ramp.jpg" alt="ramp" class="featured-image">
                    <p>A wheelchair ramp is an inclined plane installed in addition to or instead of stairs. Ramps
                        permit wheelchair users, as well as people pushing strollers, carts, or other wheeled objects,
                        to more easily access a building.

                        A wheelchair ramp can be permanent, semi-permanent or portable. Permanent ramps are designed to
                        be bolted or otherwise attached in place. Semi-permanent ramps rest on top of the ground or
                        concrete pad and are commonly used for the short term. Permanent and semi-permanent ramps are
                        usually of aluminum, concrete or wood. Portable ramps are usually aluminum and typically fold
                        for ease of transport. Portable ramps are primarily intended for home and building use but can
                        also be used with vans to load an unoccupied mobility device or to load an occupied mobility
                        device when both the device and the passenger are easy to handle.

                        Ramps must be carefully designed in order to be useful. In many places, laws dictate a ramp's
                        minimum width and maximum slope.

                        In general, reduced incline rises are easier for wheelchair users to traverse and are safer in
                        icy climates. However, they consume more space and require traveling a greater distance to go
                        up. Hence, in some cases it is preferable to include an elevator or other type of wheelchair
                        lift.

                        In many countries, wheelchair ramps and other features to facilitate universal access are
                        required by building code when constructing new facilities which are open to the public.
                        Internationally, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
                        mandates nations take action to "enable persons with disabilities to live independently and
                        participate fully in all aspects of life." Among other requirements, it compels countries to
                        institute "minimum standards and guidelines..." for accessibility.</p>

                    <img src="assets/image/guding.jpg" alt="guding" class="featured-image">
                    <p>One of the different views on public roads now is the presence of tiles with long dot and line
                        textures found on the sidewalk. These tiles are called Guiding Blocks. Guiding Block if
                        interpreted into the Indonesian language means a block or mold as a road guide. Meaning Guiding
                        Block is a ceramic or tile that has a special design such as dots and straight lines intended to
                        help direct pedestrians who have special needs, especially for blind people. Besides being named
                        Guiding Block, the textured tile is also known as Tactile Paving or Kenji Block.

                        The installation of the Guiding Block is an application of Minister of Public Works Regulation
                        No. 30 of 2006 concerning Technical Guidelines for Facilities and Accessibility in Buildings and
                        Environments. One of the accessibility is to use various public facilities for the disabled,
                        especially the visually impaired by utilizing Guiding Block which adapts textures on braile
                        letters so that they are easily recognized and can make it easier for blind people. Guiding
                        Block is installed at public places and facilities such as sidewalks, terminals, stations and
                        city parks.</p>

                    <h3>Sign Language</h3>
                    <img src="assets/image/sign.png" alt="sign-language" class="featured-image">
                    <p>Sign languages (also known as signed languages) are languages that use the visual-manual modality
                        to convey meaning. Sign languages are expressed through manual articulations in combination with
                        non-manual elements. Sign languages are full-fledged natural languages with their own grammar
                        and lexicon. Sign languages are not universal and they are not mutually intelligible with each
                        other, although there are also striking similarities among sign languages.

                        Linguists consider both spoken and signed communication to be types of natural language, meaning
                        that both emerged through an abstract, protracted aging process and evolved over time without
                        meticulous planning. Sign language should not be confused with body language, a type of
                        nonverbal communication.

                        Wherever communities of deaf people exist, sign languages have developed as handy means of
                        communication and they form the core of local deaf cultures. Although signing is used primarily
                        by the deaf and hard of hearing, it is also used by hearing individuals, such as those unable to
                        physically speak, those who have trouble with spoken language due to a disability or condition
                        (augmentative and alternative communication), or those with deaf family members, such as
                        children of deaf adults.

                        It is unclear how many sign languages currently exist worldwide. Each country generally has its
                        own native sign language, and some have more than one. The 2013 edition of Ethnologue lists 137
                        sign languages. Some sign languages have obtained some form of legal recognition, while others
                        have no status at all.

                        Linguists distinguish natural sign languages from other systems that are precursors to them or
                        derived from them, such as invented manual codes for spoken languages, home sign, "baby sign",
                        and signs learned by non-human primates.</p>
